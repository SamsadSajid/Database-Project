# Database-Project
This project is part of our Database project in Undergraduation at Level 3 Term 1 in BUET. In this project, we used MongoDB database and for the dataset, we used Twitter dataset of year 2013. Total amount of data, on which we have run some queries, is 12.5GB. We used Python as a driver for the Database. Here are some python files and the related result after running those queries (you'll find in them in the python files) on the dataset.
